# Really simple digital twins mockup

This project is a simple digital twin of a server rack built with Unity for visualization and ASP.NET Core for backend data. It demonstrates how server status, temperature, and CPU usage can be fetched from a backend and visualized in Unity.

This is a mockup / demo and uses simulated data from the backend.
